Single-Page-Applications (SPA) have many advantages over more traditionally
websites. The development of those SPA requires the use of multiple
technologies. Angular2 is eyeing for the throne on the frontend side. The D
Programming Language is an often underestimated candidate for the backend
side. Its compile time introspection features allows to develop powerful REST
APIs in an efficent, natural feeling way. 

But all that is not enough to make the development of a SPA a success. The
development process is equaliy as important if not more important. The
traditionally Waterfall model no longer scales and there are also shortcomings
with agile methods. This talk will present a small but powerful tool that
feels agile, enables the user to keep the documentation in sync with the code,
and free's the user from writing nearly all boilerplate.
